# CISP-430-Data-Structures
 Class taken in 2021 at American River College
 This course applies object-oriented techniques for systematic problem analysis and the managing of program complexity using abstraction. Specification, design, coding, testing, and documentation of large multi-file programs are covered. It uses advanced language features such as classes, strings, non-text files, pointers, and recursion. Abstract data types such as stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, heaps/priority queues, hash tables, and graphs are examined. Various sorting and searching algorithms are presented and analyzed using Big-O notation.
